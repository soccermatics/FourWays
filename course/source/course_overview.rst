Getting started

The aim of this site is to provide extra details for some of the chapters in the Four Ways book. 
Unlike in the book itself, I do assume some knowldge of mathematics on the part of the reader. 

This page provides some resources to help you get started on your mathematical journey and so you 
have the background to follow the chapters made available on this website.
