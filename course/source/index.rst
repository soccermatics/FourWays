**Four Ways of Thinking**

-------
Welcome
-------

This is the companion website to David Sumpter's book 
`Four Ways of Thinking <https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/321012/four-ways-of-thinking-by-sumpter-david/9780241604069>`_.

The purpose of these pages is to allow those who want to, 
to get deeper in to the mathematics discussed 
in the book. Many of the topics --- maximum likelihood, :ref:`chaos<chaosbutterfly>` 
entropy etc. --- are usually taught in university maths and statsitics courses, 
often in the second or third years. They are advanced topics. In these pages, 
I show step-by-step how they work, starting from high school mathematics. 

These pages shouldn't be taken as a textbook on the various subjects covered. Instead, they are things I personally
find interesting about the mathematics. I want to provide an approach which can be useful to
students (upper secondary school or early university... maybe thinking about what you would study at
univesity...), teachers (looking for examples to illustrate why maths is useful) and professionals 
(interested in a new way of seeing maths). Each section gives links to useful background, mainly to 
BBC Byte Size and to Khan Academy.

Many of the examples include code in Python. I recommend you download 
`Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution>`_ and run the code in either a `Google Colab
Notebook <https://colab.research.google.com>`_
 (download .ipynb files) or using `Spyder <https://www.spyder-ide.org>`_ (download .py files). 
 Personally, I learn mathematics best
when I have example applications, code to run which solves numerical examples, a graphical understanding,
along with the maths. It is all of these which I am to provide here.  



and run the code
